Subject: glamor: No need to glFlush before destroying a pixmap.

I assume this was a workaround for an old, broken, closed driver.  The
driver doesn't get to throw away rendering just because the rendering
context's shared-across-processes render target is getting freed from
the local address space.  If the rendering isn't to a shared render
target, then we *do* want to throw away the rendering to it.
